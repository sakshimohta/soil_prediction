# üå± Soil Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Soil Prediction Project! This repository demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to agricultural data to predict **soil types** or **soil fertility properties** based on chemical and physical features. This can aid farmers, researchers, and agritech developers in making informed decisions about crop selection, fertilization, and land use.

## üìñ Project Overview

Soil is one of the most critical natural resources for agriculture. By predicting soil types or fertility levels using data-driven models, we can:

- Enhance precision agriculture
- Recommend suitable crops
- Minimize overuse of fertilizers
- Improve sustainability in farming

This project uses **supervised machine learning** techniques to build models that can predict the soil category based on measured properties.

## üßæ Dataset

> üìÇ **Note:** Include your dataset file (e.g., `soil_data.csv`) or link to the source here.

The dataset contains samples with the following features:

- **Soil pH**
- **Nitrogen (N)**
- **Phosphorus (P)**
- **Potassium (K)**
- **Moisture**
- **Temperature**
- **Soil Type** (Target Variable)

## üß† Machine Learning Models

We implemented and evaluated several ML models to find the best-performing one:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

Each model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The top-performing model is saved using `pickle` for future use.
